# atom-kitura
Kitura package for Atom

This is a fork of [Kitura.tmbundle](https://github.com/macavon/Kitura.tmbundle).

Commands and snippets for working with [Kitura](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura) applications and [Stencil](https://github.com/kylef/Stencil) templates.

## How to use

### Install using APM
```
$ apm install atom-kitura
```
Files with extensions `.stencil` are recognised as Stencil templates. The tab triggers and command shortcuts for Swift source files only work if the file type is set to `Swift Kitura`.
